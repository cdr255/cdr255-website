#### Part I: The Interrogation ####

__Jareth__, __Zacharia__, __Rane__, __Arydin__, and __Sharazad__ have
all been captured once again: this time, by the Resistance. They have
been tied up to chairs, with bags over their heads, and are awakened
with buckets of sea water poured overtop of them.

They are not immediately aware of their surroundings, and __Jareth__
even shouts out that he cannot see. He is immediately removed from the
room, put into a cage, and dragged along the side of the ship in the
seawater, as he is an Air Creature, a Goblin, and unorderly. The rest
of the party is then questioned by a man, and found to be satisfactory
for their purposes.

They are then reunited with Jareth, and all held over the side of the
ship, in threat of drowning should they refuse the job. __Rane__
doesn't like this one bit, and changes into her _Dire Bat Form_,
escaping from her handlers and taking perch atop the main-mast of the
ship. She is talked down, and they are told a sob story about a
captured member of the resistance, Liana. 

They are given a week to proceed down the dungeon on a secluded
island, find her, and bring her back to this same spot on the
shore. Should they fail to be there, or die trying, they will be
considered to be rebelling against the resistance's orders, and
therefore be treated as enemies.

With that, they are armed and fed as they saw fit, and spent the three
day journey mostly below decks, until they came on the island.

#### Part II: Entering the Dungeon ####

They land their row boat on the shore of the snowy island, and
immediately see a small fort in the distance. This is the prison, they
surmise, and begin heading towards it.
