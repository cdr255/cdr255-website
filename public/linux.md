## GNU/Linux

I do all of my work, from music composition, to game development, to
creating this website, on [GNU/Linux][linux].

If You'd like to give it a try, I recommend
[this website's quiz][quiz] as a way to pick a distribution to
try. Or, You can do what I did: Jump in the deep end with
[Slackware Linux][slackware].

Thanks for this operating system are due to two people, and their
respective groups:

 - [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)][rms] and the
   [Free Software Foundation][fsf] for founding and developing all of
   the free software tools that this system is built on.

 - [Linus Torvalds][linus] and the [Linux Foundation][lf], which
   created the kernel and advocate for its use worldwide.
