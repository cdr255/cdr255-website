order. Please, Enjoy, and stay tuned to the above hashtag for updates!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It was the event that still tied them together, and to this place: The Begrove Estate, a mansion sat on ten acres of pinelands. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/tintenn?src=hash">#tintenn</a></p>&mdash; Chris Rodriguez (@cdr255) <a href="https://twitter.com/cdr255/status/660246019754565633">October 31, 2015</a></blockquote>


<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It was her old workplace. His old &#39;birthright&#39;. They&#39;d avoided it, together, since the tragedy over ten year ago.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The storm outside continued to rage as their (his) limosine made its slow and steady crawl through now neglected rural roads. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/tintenn?src=hash">#tintenn</a></p>&mdash; Chris Rodriguez (@cdr255) <a href="https://twitter.com/cdr255/status/664204798267408385">November 10, 2015</a></blockquote>


<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The umbrella leaned beside her in a caddy, wet from its use over an hour before. It languidly danced with the curves in the road. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/tintenn?src=hash">#tintenn</a></p>&mdash; Chris Rodriguez (@cdr255) <a href="https://twitter.com/cdr255/status/666609447838552064">November 17, 2015</a></blockquote>


<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">She sat across from him, her black-gloved hands folded in her lap.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Each moment, silently slinking by between them, marked just how estranged they&#39;d become since leaving Begrove to try to live again. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/tintenn?src=hash">#tintenn</a></p>&mdash; Chris Rodriguez (@cdr255) <a href="https://twitter.com/cdr255/status/667507868153847808">November 20, 2015</a></blockquote>


<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">As the car rolled to a stop, they each silently prepared to venture forth: She fixing her hat and gloves, he grabbing the umbrella. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/tintenn?src=hash">#tintenn</a></p>&mdash; Chris Rodriguez (@cdr255) <a href="https://twitter.com/cdr255/status/670840556042498049">November 29, 2015</a></blockquote>


<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In the end, she was the one who broke the silence: &quot;After You... Lon.&quot; The hesitation in that pet name meant more than the gesture. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/tintenn?src=hash">#tintenn</a></p>&mdash; Chris Rodriguez (@cdr255) <a href="https://twitter.com/cdr255/status/683053200371482625">January 1, 2016</a></blockquote>


<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">They emerged from the car, announced by a muffled rustling of the umbrella, followed by the firework-scattering sound of raindrops. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/tintenn?src=hash">#tintenn</a></p>&mdash; Chris Rodriguez (@cdr255) <a href="https://twitter.com/cdr255/status/683506730643374080">January 3, 2016</a></blockquote>
