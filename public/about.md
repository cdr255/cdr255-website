## About Me

My name is Christopher Rodriguez.

### Music

I am a musician from the South Jersey Area, currently living in
Hi-Nella. I play the [lever harp][harp], the [electric bass][bass],
the [5 string banjo][banjo], and the [anglo concertina][concertina]
alongside a lot of other instruments.

I've been playing music for 10 years now, ever since I picked up my
mom's old 6 string in Sophmore year of High School. I
[give lessons][lessons] for the guitar and banjo, as well as
[perform][perform] and [compose][compose]. I'm involved with a few
local bands, as well.

I also make music using [LSDJ][lsdj].

### Technology

I am a big supporter of [GNU/Linux][linux]. I do all of my work on
*NIX based computers, and maintain computers for others with
[Windows][windows] and [OS/X][osx] installed.

I do [data recovery][data] along with [system repair][sys] for people
(freelance style) near me. I have built and run many websites over the
years, and maintain this website myself. I am familiar with many
different languages and paradigms, but I am most used to [C++][cpp],
[lua][lua], [ruby][ruby], and [e-LISP][lisp].

I am on [github][github], too!

### Games

I play a lot of games, and I am something of a game designer, as well.

I've run some [tabletop role-playing games][log], and I like to
[review][review] both video and board games as well. I am on
[steam][steam].

I have a few [projects][projects] in the works, including a tabletop
roleplaying system, a territory holding board game, a deck of symbol
cards, and an abstract city building game. I am on
[boardgamegeek][bgg].
