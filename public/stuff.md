## Other Stuff

This page collects all items I work on that have no better, proper
place yet. If enough of a certain item amass here, I will move them to
their own section.

### Character Sheets

Character sheets are compact, organized ways to store all of the
information about a specific character in the context of a
[TTRPG][ttrpg]. These here are custom sheets I have made for one
reason or another, that are __not__ for my own games.

### Forms

These are all [elisp][elisp] files for use in [GNU/Emacs][emacs] (in
[forms-mode][forms]) that I use for one reason or another. They are
usable on any OS, because [GNU/Emacs][emacs] works on any OS... And
are the most efficient, compact way to store
information. [Here][formspost] is a blog post I wrote about why I like
to use them instead of [.doc][msdoc] files or [pdfs][pdfs].
