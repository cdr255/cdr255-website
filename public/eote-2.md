#### Part I: The Guard Captain ####

After defeating the Sleeping Guards last time, they take a few minutes
to survey their surroundings. The party notices a pair of trap doors
on either side of the room, as well as the lockers on the North
wall. __Rane__ also decides to check each of the dead bodies, in the
hopes of finding something interesting.

The   task  of   opening   the  doors   falls   to  __Sharazad__   and
__Zacharia__. They decide to do so at the same time, and reveal both a
bound and dazed  __Dark Air Goblin__, and the  corpse of another, less
fortunate elemental  Goblin. The  __Dark Air Goblin__  (__Jareth__) is
rescued, untied,  and welcomed by the  party, though once  he is fully
awake __Zacharia__ is less trusting of him.

Meanwhile, __Rane__ is searching the bodies of their most recent
assailants, and finds a key. She Pockets the key for now, and joins
the rest of the party near the trap doors.

__Arydin__ points out the existance of the lockers, and he,
__Sharazad__, and __Zacharia__ all raid their contents. Other than a
few weapons and armor suits, bereft of purpose now that their owners
are dead, they find a few personal items now orphened, which they
decide to adopt: _A Small Portrait of a Woman, A Rag Doll, A Bottle of
Some Red Liquid, and a Box._ After __Arydin__ and __Zacharia__ enjoy
some spooning beneath the beds, the party turns its attention to the
door in the North Wall.

__Sharazad__ tries the door, and finds it to be locked. __Rane__ then
uses her newfound key on it, but it doesn't seem to work. They then
use the key they found on the ring by their cell, and open the door to
reveal the Guard Captain: Fully Awake, Fully Armored, and Fully angry.


#### Part II: The Guard Captain and the Fork. ####
The party fights the Guard Captain, and __Jareth__ holds his own as they
do so. After the fight, they raid his room, finding one final
key. This, they soon discover, is the key to the locked Grate from
before.

They go to the grate, and unlock it, rushing through the corridors in
an attempt to make it to the top of the tower in time.

They have fifteen minutes left to get there.

Unfortunately, they come to a fork in the dungeon, with staircases
leading up both to the left and the right. From the left, they hear
only the sound of the rushing waters outside. From the right, they
hear hushed talk in some dialect of goblin, though they can't make it
out clearly. Talking it over, they decide to take the safer route and
head left, to the sound of the crashing waves. 

They enter a room full of cages, with a large pedestal in the center
of the room. On the pedestal is a Large Green Gemstone, which is
glowing green. In each of the cages is an elemental halfbreed (Such as
an Air Goblin, or Water Elve), branded with a symbol denoting their
elemental origin. They have obviously been here for quite some time,
and by the looks of them, are the regular subjects of torture. The
party could not help them, and time was running out, so they
immediately moved on up the next flight of stairs, to the top of the
tower.

To their surprise, this tower has no windows.

In this top room of the tower, there are only 3 ornately decorated
chests: One with Green Gems, one with Blue Gems, and one with Red
Gems. The party opens the one on the left, and some kind of smokey
spirit escapes, leaving behind bags of (oddly light weight) gold. They
take this gold, and leave, running down the stairs.

__Sharazad__, struck with a sense of greed as she once again passes by
such a large gemstone, decides to grab it as they attempt to
leave. This summons 4 Large Elemental Guardians to the room, meant to
scare and torment the creatures at the guards will. However, none in
the party look at all like guards, so they begin to attack everyone in
the room, for the next minute.

__Zacharia__ and __Arydin__ escape up to the room with the chests,
while __Rane__, __Sharazad__, and __Jareth__ Stay in the room, or
attempt to go out the other door. Once the Elementals Fizzle, the
party continues down the stairs, leaving the gemstone behind, lest it
again summon the elementals which almost killed them.

#### Part III: Goblins and a Leap of Faith ####

They ascend the other flight of stairs, and come face to face with the
Goblin Guard from earlier... and 3 other of his kind. They are
attempting to stall the party, having signalled for more guards to come as
soon as possible. They fail, and are killed as the party rushes up the
stairs, trying hard to make it before the Resistance's Ship leaves.

However, upon arriving at the top of the tower, they can see no ship
waiting below the window. Assuming that the boat is still there (or at
least, that to stay here would (at best) mean their torture and death,
they decide to jump anyway.

As they fall, they find their speed gradually slowing, allowing them
to land safely upon an invisible platform over the waters of the
lake. Once safely landed, they are all hit on the back of the heads,
and knocked unconsious.

What will happen to the party? Who knocked everyone out? And what do a
horse and a bat have in common?

Find out next time, on "The End of the Empire: Adventure Log."
