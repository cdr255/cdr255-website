## My Conlangs

I do a bit of [Conlanging][conlang] in my spare time, especially for
my games and stories. Here's what I have done to the point where I can
share it.

### Valleyscript

[Truetype Font][ttf-valley]

Used to write and read the common tongue in the world of
__Esoterica__, though as of right now it has the glyphs necessary to
read and write English.

### Vinescript

__Truetype Font__ _(Coming Soon!)_

The first fully usable script I ever created. It was originally for
use in a [DND][dnd] campaign I was running at the time, but I am
currently thinking of using it in another project I have ongoing.
