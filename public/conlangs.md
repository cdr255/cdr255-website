## My Conlangs

I do a bit of [Conlanging][conlang] in my spare time, especially for
my games and stories. Here's what I have done to the point where I can
share it.

### Valleyscript

[Truetype Font][ttf-valley]

Used to write and read the common tongue in the world of
__Esoterica__, though as of right now it has the glyphs necessary to
read and write English.

### Vinescript

__Truetype Font__ _(Coming Soon!)_

The first fully usable script I ever created. It was originally for
use in a [DND][dnd] campaign I was running at the time, but I am
currently thinking of using it in another project I have ongoing.

### Wirescript

__Truetype Font__ _(Coming Later!)_

This script came from an idea where a culture has no access to inks or
dyes, but bountiful access to metals and precious stones... to the
point where they are used for writing, and not worth very much. The
script's lower part is meant to be some kind of metal wire set into
another medium, and the upper part is meant to be differently cut
precious stones, depending on the vowel in question.
