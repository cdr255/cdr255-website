### Last Update: 2015-09-05

Welcome to my little corner of the web. My name is Christopher
Rodriguez. I make music, games, and programs.

This site is my repository for any work I have published in some way-
from [sheet music][sheet] to [technical guides][tech], from
[alpha games][games] to [Conlangs and Scripts][fonts]. For simple
recollections of how my work is going, I have a
[blog called Toft and Toddy][toft].

If You like something You see, want to work with me, or in general
just want to say hi: Feel free to [email me][email]. Alternatively, I
am fairly active on [social media][social] as well.
