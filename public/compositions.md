### CDR-W: The Preliminary Opretta of Pretty Music

This is my first series, and as such is fairly eclectic in its
theming. If a piece doesn't fit anywhere else, it will be added to
this one.

2. [Dancing on the Waves][dancing]
3. __A Night of Peace and Innocence__ _(Missing as of 2015-04-29)_
4. [The Quest of the Cat][cat]

### CDR-HR: Harp Regalia

The story of a year in a fictional persons life, with each piece
representing not a month or a season, but a milestone event that
happened.

1. [Calea Victoriei][calea]

---

### CDR-BNY: The Bononyvi Tale

A tale from the legends of a fictional people (who, by the way, have
their own [language][conlang]) where two kingdoms clash before
realizing the root of their conflict was a common enemy they could
work together to defeat.

2. [Sky Will Forget the Brilliant][sky]

### CDR-GNR: Genera

With this series, I wanted to see how I would design the music for a
standard [jRPG][jrpg] from the 90's. I don't have a story to go
alongside it, yet. _(as of 2015-04-29)_

1. [Title Theme][title]

---

### CDR-NBV: Nubivagant

The soundtrack to a [Visual Novel][vn] I am developing where a young
woman is suddenly confronted with the chance to "Walk on the Wind,"
and must decide for herself whether or not the risks involved are
worth it.

1. [Nubivagant (Wind Quartet)][nubivagant]

---

### CDR-PNU: Penant Umbra

An Idea I had while I was watching some movies turned into a concept
for a song, and a series, expressing the dual... or tri... nature of
life, depending upon one's current perspective.

1. [Penant Umbra][penantumbra]

---

### CDR-PYG: Project Pygmalion

Two engaged lovers find an antique dress at a pawn shop and compete in
a dangerous sport to win it. A cyberpunk romantic tragedy with
horrific undertones. And each scene is going to have a piece of music
associated with it.

1. [&#91;PYG&#93; Malion][pygmalion] - The title theme

[cc]: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/ "I license all of my own creative work with this license. I hated, as a young musician, feeling as though I were stealing from people as I tried to learn or play songs or tunes by people I admired. Let me know if You use one of my songs; It would make my day."
[autumn]: https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdr255/compositions/cdr-w01.an-autumnal-meeting.pdf "This was the first composition I ever actually wrote out, in its entirety. It's special to me, even if it is a bit amateurish."
[dancing]: https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdr255/compositions/cdr-w02.dancing-on-the-waves.pdf "With this piece, I relaxed a bit. I wanted to do something a little more bouncy and having the feel of riding on a small ship into port."
[cat]: https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdr255/compositions/cdr-w04.quest-of-the-cat.pdf "This piece was inspired in no small part by the cat I was living with at the time (and I still am as of 2015-04-29!), named Casanova. He has a habit of moving as though he is exploring no matter what he is actually doing, and I wanted to communicate that sense of innocent wonder."
[high]: https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdr255/compositions/cdr-w05.high-resolutions.pdf "I wrote this piece during my brief tenure on Reddit's /r/songaweek challenge as a theme for my new year's resolutions for 2015. I once saw a documentary where Marcus Mumford, of Mumford and Sons, said that he cannot simply sit down and write a song by himself. He needs it to develop over time, by bouncing ideas off of others. I feel like I am closer to his style of songwriting than the other way of doing it."
[calea]: https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdr255/compositions/cdr-hr01.calea-victoriei.pdf "The title is Romanian (possibly butchered, I am unsure) for 'I Started,' which is exactly what was important to me when I wrote it. I wanted to have a harp piece I wrote myself, no matter if it was a masterpiece or a jingle."
[conlang]: /conlangs "I do actually do a fair amount of conlanging in my spare time. The idea always fascinated me: creating a language defines so much more about a culture and a world than would otherwise be discussed."
[memory]: https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdr255/compositions/cdr-bny01.a-memory-withdraws.pdf "The titles for this entire series started something with my naming schemes. I really liked the titles put out by some older VN soundtracks, that were mistranslated very badly... They almost had an artistry to them that wouldn't have been as powerful if I knew the correct title. Odd."
[sky]: https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdr255/compositions/cdr-bny02.sky-will-forget-the-brilliant.pdf "With this piece I wanted to represent the feeling of sitting on a dew drenched hill in the middle of the night with a close friend, discussing Your insecurities which You would hide were You anywhere else."
[battle]: https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdr255/compositions/cdr-bny03.for-battle-some-personality.pdf "This was meant to describe the feeling of being in a fight and wanted to stop it, but knowing that if You try You will simply get hit in the face, so You keep Your guard up but never actually attack. It is kinda short; I want to go back and make it longer."
[jrpg]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Eastern_role-playing_video_games#Japanese_console_RPGs "jRPGs were one of my three mainstays as a child, and as I listen to a LOT of video game soundtracks as my everyday music, its no surprise to me that the composers of the jRPG golden age were a huge influence on me."
[title]: https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdr255/compositions/cdr-gnr01.title-theme.pdf "This piece was the first one I ever wrote with the specific intention to be used in a video game. The motifs are a bit overused, but I think it still came together well."
[vn]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_novel "Visual Novels are NOT porn games, though I definitely understand why they have that reputation. While some are simply malodorous tripe, others are beautifully written and told stories with memorable plotlines and characters. Just like any artform, it is a means of expression, not confined to one area of storytelling."
[nubivagant]: https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdr255/compositions/cdr-nbv01.nubivagant-wind-quartet.pdf "Nubivagant is an old, out of use word which means 'Wandering through clouds, moving through the air'. I want to convey the wind, and birds, with this piece."
[penantumbra]: https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdr255/compositions/cdr-pnu01-penant-umbra-theme.pdf "I am actually pretty excited about this series, and what might grow from it. It is pretty loosely defined at the moment, but hopefully as I finish/progress with some of my other projects it will solidify a bit more."
[pygmalion]: https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdr255/compositions/cdr-pyg01-_pyg_-malion.pdf "I began work on this story as a part of Camp NaNoWriMo, in July 2015. I ended the month with a bit under 13000 words written, but I am continuing my work on it in the time between now and November. Hopefully the first draft will be done by then."
