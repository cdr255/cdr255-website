## Collections

On my old site, I had a section for each of my major instruments which
collected all of the pieces I had played along with relevant
information about each.. I also had, on my computer, a table for each
video game system I owned which listed the games I had amassed... and
I was beginning to tabulate other collections of things I was
amassing, such as board games and wargame armies.

After stalling for two weeks trying to format these collections
uniformly and properly for this new site, I have decided instead to
make that the duty of my blog, [Toft and Toddy][toft]. This page will
link to the most recent versions of each of my collections, as they
are written.
