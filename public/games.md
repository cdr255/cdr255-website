## Games I am Working On

I am a bit of a game designer, and these are my projects.

### Tabletop Games

#### True20 Supplements

I'm currently about to launch a new ttrpg campaign using the
[True20][true20] system, and figured I would post the WIP-style SRDs
I'm developing because of that here as they are finished.

 - [Backgrounds][true20bgs]
 - [The Falodian Pantheon][true20pan]
 - [Map of Beebrook Region][true20map]

#### Original Games

 - __DERPS__ - the Dynamically Equivalent Role Playing System.
 - __The Duchies__ - Build up Your city better than anyone
   elses.
 - __Elemental Warfare__ - A game about gaining and holding on to
   territory.
 - __Three Way__ - A point collecting game based around choosing Your
   own path.
